		<articletitle>Vlugger, a plugin manager for Vim

		</articletitle>

    <article class="articlewrapper">


			<p>I've been using Vim with pathogen for a while now, and I noticed that it is very long and very annoying to write, each time i wanted to install a plugin</p>
<pre>
git clone https://github.com/&lsaquo;user&rsaquo;/&lsaquo;repo&rsaquo; ~/.vim/bundle/&lsaquo;repo&rsaquo;
cd ~
git submodule add https://github.com/&lsaquo;user&rsaquo;/&lsaquo;repo&rsaquo; ~/.vim/bundle/&lsaquo;repo</pre><p></p>

I could use another plugin manager like Vundle, but I wanted to have directly the repo cloned to make it easily updatable and to not to be dependent to an external system.

</p><p>
So, I decided to make that simple program to install and search easily for plugins.

It is written in Rust, and basically makes a call to github api to find a repo and uses git clone to download plugin, like you would do in command line.
</p><p>
I plan to add an update command, that would execute <code>git pull</code> in every plugin folder and to open for other git remotes.</p>
