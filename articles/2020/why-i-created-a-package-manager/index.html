    <articletitle>Why I created a package manager for C lang</articletitle>
    <article class="articlewrapper">
        

        <p>A few months ago, I was wondering why we hoard Makefiles and why it is so painful to use an external library in a C project.</p>

        <p>So I had this idea : Creating a project manager & build tool for the C programming language.</p>

        <p>I started to write a piece of code in C and it was not functionning properly (Cause I'm one of the worst C developers in this world) but i continued 'till we cannot run that thing.</p>

        <p>At the same time, I was learning Rust ; so, I decided to try to rewrite the whole project in that language.</p>

        <p>After a few weeks of rewriting, I had a correct product. The 08/10/2020, Wanager 1.0 was released. It had only a few features : project creation and reinitializing, project build and run and header creation. </p>

        <p>At that point, someone called Lockeer told me that it will be cool if we can manage libraries. </p>
    
        <p>So I wrote a simple system to install libraries hosted on my vps, with a submission system based on mailing. It was working, but limited because of vps bandwidth and the complexity of submiting by email.</p>
    
        <p>So SuperFola poped up :</p>

        <p>At first time, I decided, as he advised me, to use the github api that produces a tar archive of the repo.<br>
            I stucked on that for weeks because the command I was running was producing a corrupted file. </p>
    
        <p>After raging on that problem, I realised that I'll gain some portability and time with cloning directly with a git command. </p>
    
        <p>It worked good, so, everything is fine !</p>
    
        <p>But Il_totore opened an issue :</p>
        <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61330081/96449715-8df21d80-1215-11eb-9a22-588c77ce9870.png" alt="iltotore">
    
        <p>So I made python support for build scripts with minimal version of 3.5.x and allowed path specification.</p>

        <p>After that, on his advice, I made kind of Python API to have nice build scripts and it produced <a href="https://gist.github.com/Wafelack/7ab5ae29e01ac1227a36bda835c7904f">that</a> :</p>

        <p>It is still WIP, there are loads of features that I can add to it but I will be more very happy to answer your questions or help you use it.</p>

        <p class="last">Thanks for reading and have a nice day.</p>
