		<h1>How is this blog made</h1>
		<hr>

		<!-- Content starts here -->

		<p>This blog is written using only HTML and CSS, in the most powerful text editor: Vim.</p>
		<p>I don't use any Static Site Generator because they usually mess up your repo with lots of files, and, as I have very low design tastes, it is after all easier to write my 40 lines of CSS by hand than configuring a whole generator.</p>
		<p>Articles on this blog follow a homemade template generated by <a href="https://github.com/Wafelack/wafelack.github.io/blob/master/new_article.sh">a simple shell script.</a>

		<p>This website does not run any Javascript code (you can check). It is available <a href="https://github.com/wafelack/wafelack.github.io">on my GitHub</a> and is licensed under the GNU GPL 3.0+.</p>
